Not ready to merge! This issue is about to develop a solution to test failing case in foundationdb adapter repo for
Janusgraph. Code changes followed idea to collect data from janusgraph instance about to change inside store and manage
transactions to not become old during commit. Higher-level transaction instance should take care about saving up actions
and run them without exceptions and not violating fdb store rules.
ToDo: Still need to find a solution, that does not end exceptionally and delivers at least same results as original solution
